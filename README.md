# TBO-Tree-Gen

This add-on for Blender 2.8+ creates trees procedurally by implementing a space colonialization algorithm.

## Features

The main advantages of this add-on compared to most other tree generation add-ons for Blender are:

- **Control:** The user is in total control of the shape and size of the tree. Defining the overall shape of the tree and tweaking minor details are clearly separated workflows and will not interfere with one another.
- **Realism:** Since the trees which are grown by this add-on emulate the natural process of competing for space, they will look organic and be free of artifacts like intersecting branches.
- **Multiple Trees:** With this workflow multiple trees can be "grown" into one single interconnected shape without clipping into each other (i.e. a hedge consisting of multiple individual plants).
- **Quad-dominance:** The meshes generated by this add-on are quad-dominant and should behave nicely when further processing or rendering them.
- **Speed:** All the "heavy lifting" in this add-on is done in C++. This ensures high efficiency and cuts down on processing time and memory consumption, making it viable to create complex trees even on low-end machines.

## Installation

1. Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/TheBeautifulOrc/TBO-Tree-Gen/releases) page and download the repository **with compiled C++ binaries** as a .zip-file.
2. Open Blender 2.8+.
3. Go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons` and click the `Install` button in the top-right corner.
4. Select the downloaded .zip-file and you're done.
